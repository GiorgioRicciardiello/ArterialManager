üî¨ Vascular Colocalization Batch Runner (External Drive Version)
=============================================================

This script automates the batch analysis of vascular colocalization
between paired fluorescent images (green = C=0, red = C=1) stored
on an external hard drive.

It is designed for collaborators who have the dataset saved on
different drives (e.g., D:, E:, F:). The script automatically
searches for the correct path across all available drives.

Workflow
--------
1. Define the relative path of your dataset:
       "Vascular images/FINAL/Colored/Same contrast"
2. The script will:
   - Search across all drives (A‚ÄìZ) for that path.
   - Process only top-level folders (ignores nested ones).
   - Skip any folders already processed (output exists).
3. Results are saved to a sibling folder named:
       "<drive>:/Vascular images/FINAL/Colored/processed_overlap"

Outputs
-------
- Per-cell results inside:
      processed_overlap/<cell_folder>/
- Aggregated CSV of all results:
      processed_overlap/all_metrics_with_paths.csv

Usage
-----
1. Place this script inside your project folder.
2. Run from the command line (Windows PowerShell or CMD):

       python run_overlap_drive.py

3. Make sure your external HDD/SSD is plugged in and accessible.

Notes
-----
- Assumes paired .jpg images exist in each folder:
    * C=0 ‚Üí green channel
    * C=1 ‚Üí red channel
- Skips MERGE and scaled artifacts (jpgscale).
- Skips already processed folders to save time.
- Requires conda/pip environment with dependencies installed.
